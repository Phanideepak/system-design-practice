# System Design using Python and Java.

If you're looking to set up a Python environment on your own system, here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### 1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
   - Ensure you add Python to the system's PATH during installation.

---

### 2. **Install a Package Manager (pip)**
   - Pip usually comes pre-installed with Python. You can verify this by running:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```
   - If pip is missing, install it using:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip
     ```

---

### 3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   - To avoid conflicts between projects, use a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env_name
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
     - **Windows**:
       ```bash
       env_name\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **macOS/Linux**:
       ```bash
       source env_name/bin/activate
       ```

---

### 4. **Install Required Packages**
   - Use pip to install libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install package_name
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
     ```

---

### 5. **Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
   - Popular options:
     - **VS Code** (add Python extensions)
     - **PyCharm**
     - **Jupyter Notebook**:
       ```bash
       pip install notebook
       ```

---

### 6. **Test the Environment**
   - Create a test script (`test.py`):
     ```python
     print("Hello, Python environment is set up!")
     ```
   - Run it:
     ```bash
     python test.py
     ```
