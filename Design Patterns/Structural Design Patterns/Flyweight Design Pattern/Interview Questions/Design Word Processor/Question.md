# Design Word Processor

- We are given with a keyboard and need to type some text in the word document. For typing a word, we need character, font type, size, row - horizontal position, col - vertical position in a document.

## Intuition

- Instrinsic Data among all the Character objects is character, size and font_type.
- Extrinsic Data among all the character objects is row, col.
