### **Object Pool Design Pattern**

**Intent**:  
The Object Pool design pattern is used to manage a pool of reusable objects, minimizing the overhead of creating and destroying objects. This is particularly useful when object creation is resource-intensive, and you need a limited number of instances in use at any time.

---

### **Key Features**:
1. **Reusability**:  
   - Objects are reused instead of creating and destroying them repeatedly.

2. **Efficiency**:  
   - Reduces resource consumption, especially for expensive object creation.

3. **Controlled Access**:  
   - Provides a centralized way to manage object availability and reuse.

---

### **When to Use**:
1. When object creation is expensive in terms of time or resources.
2. When you need a limited number of objects at a time.
3. When managing objects manually is cumbersome, such as in connection pooling or thread pooling.

---

### **Advantages**:
- **Performance**: Improves performance by reusing existing objects.
- **Resource Management**: Prevents resource exhaustion by limiting the number of objects created.

### **Disadvantages**:
- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the implementation.
- **State Management**: Requires careful handling of the objectâ€™s state to avoid unintended side effects.

### **Implementation**

#### **1. Basic Object Pool**

```python
class ObjectPool:
    def __init__(self, create_instance, max_size=10):
        self._create_instance = create_instance
        self._max_size = max_size
        self._available = []
        self._in_use = set()

    def acquire(self):
        if self._available:
            obj = self._available.pop()
        elif len(self._in_use) < self._max_size:
            obj = self._create_instance()
        else:
            raise Exception("No objects available in the pool")
        self._in_use.add(obj)
        return obj

    def release(self, obj):
        if obj in self._in_use:
            self._in_use.remove(obj)
            self._available.append(obj)

# Example Usage
class Resource:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Creating a new Resource")

pool = ObjectPool(create_instance=Resource, max_size=3)

# Acquire objects
resource1 = pool.acquire()  # "Creating a new Resource"
resource2 = pool.acquire()  # "Creating a new Resource"

# Release an object back to the pool
pool.release(resource1)

# Reacquire the released object
resource3 = pool.acquire()  # Reuses resource1
```

---

#### **2. Thread-Safe Object Pool**
To ensure thread safety, use a threading lock.

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeObjectPool:
    def __init__(self, create_instance, max_size=10):
        self._create_instance = create_instance
        self._max_size = max_size
        self._available = []
        self._in_use = set()
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def acquire(self):
        with self._lock:
            if self._available:
                obj = self._available.pop()
            elif len(self._in_use) < self._max_size:
                obj = self._create_instance()
            else:
                raise Exception("No objects available in the pool")
            self._in_use.add(obj)
        return obj

    def release(self, obj):
        with self._lock:
            if obj in self._in_use:
                self._in_use.remove(obj)
                self._available.append(obj)

# Usage similar to the basic object pool
```

### **Real-World Examples**

#### **1. Database Connection Pooling**
Database connections are expensive to create, so connection pools reuse existing connections for efficiency.

```python
class Connection:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Establishing new database connection")

    def query(self, sql):
        print(f"Executing query: {sql}")

class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_size=5):
        self.pool = ObjectPool(create_instance=Connection, max_size=max_size)

# Usage
pool = ConnectionPool(max_size=3)

conn1 = pool.pool.acquire()
conn1.query("SELECT * FROM users")

conn2 = pool.pool.acquire()
pool.pool.release(conn1)

conn3 = pool.pool.acquire()  # Reuses conn1
```

---

#### **2. Thread Pooling**
Managing threads in a pool reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def worker(task_id):
    print(f"Task {task_id} is running")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Task {task_id} is done")

# Thread pool example using concurrent.futures
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    tasks = [executor.submit(worker, i) for i in range(5)]
```

### **Comparison to Other Patterns**

| **Aspect**                | **Object Pool**                   | **Singleton**                   | **Prototype**                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Reuse of multiple objects.        | Ensure a single instance.        | Cloning existing objects.    |
| **Reusability**           | High (pooling).                  | Low (single instance).          | Medium (via cloning).        |
| **Object Management**     | Dynamic reuse.                   | Single static instance.         | New instance per clone.      |
