### **`__new__` in Python**

`__new__` is a special method in Python used for creating and returning a new instance of a class. It is called **before** the `__init__` method and is primarily responsible for creating the object in memory.

---

### **Key Characteristics of `__new__`**:
1. **Static Method**:  
   - `__new__` is a static method by default, even though it's defined inside the class.

2. **Called Automatically**:  
   - It is called automatically during object instantiation, before `__init__`.

3. **Returns the Object**:  
   - Must return a new instance of the class (or a subclass). If `None` or another type is returned, `__init__` will not be called.

4. **Override When Necessary**:  
   - You rarely need to override `__new__`, but it can be useful for Singleton patterns, custom memory management, or metaclasses.

---

### **Default Implementation of `__new__`**:
When not overridden, `object.__new__` (the base class `__new__` method) is responsible for creating an instance of the class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Creating instance...")
        return super().__new__(cls)

    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing instance...")

obj = MyClass()
# Output:
# Creating instance...
# Initializing instance...
```

### **Difference Between `__new__` and `__init__`**

| Aspect                  | `__new__`                               | `__init__`                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Creates and returns a new object.       | Initializes the newly created object. |
| **Called When**         | Automatically before `__init__`.        | Automatically after `__new__`. |
| **Return Value**        | Must return the new object instance.    | Should return `None`.          |
| **Use Case**            | Customizing object creation.            | Customizing object initialization. |

### **Examples of Using `__new__`**

#### **1. Singleton Design Pattern**
Using `__new__` to ensure only one instance of the class is created.

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing Singleton...")

# Usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # True, both references point to the same instance
```

---

#### **2. Immutable Objects**
For immutable objects like tuples or strings, customization is done in `__new__` since `__init__` cannot modify them.

```python
class ImmutablePoint:
    def __new__(cls, x, y):
        instance = super().__new__(cls)
        instance._x = x
        instance._y = y
        return instance

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # Does nothing since object is already immutable
        pass

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self._x

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self._y

# Usage
point = ImmutablePoint(3, 4)
print(point.x, point.y)  # 3, 4
```

---

#### **3. Subclassing Built-in Types**
When subclassing immutable built-in types like `str`, you use `__new__` to initialize them.

```python
class CustomString(str):
    def __new__(cls, value):
        print("Creating CustomString...")
        return super().__new__(cls, value.upper())  # Convert to uppercase

    def __init__(self, value):
        print("Initializing CustomString...")

# Usage
cs = CustomString("hello")
print(cs)  # HELLO
```

---

#### **4. Metaclasses**
In metaprogramming, `__new__` can be used to control the creation of classes themselves.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, class_dict):
        print(f"Creating class: {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, class_dict)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Output:
# Creating class: MyClass
```

---

### **When to Override `__new__`**
1. **Singleton or Multiton Patterns**: Control object creation to limit instances.
2. **Immutable Objects**: Customize the creation of immutable types like `str`, `tuple`, or `frozenset`.
3. **Custom Memory Management**: Allocate memory in a specific way.
4. **Metaprogramming**: Control the creation of classes using metaclasses.

---

### **Common Mistakes**
1. **Not Calling `super().__new__`**:  
   If you override `__new__` without calling `super().__new__`, the object won't be created properly.

   ```python
   class BrokenClass:
       def __new__(cls):
           pass

   obj = BrokenClass()  # Raises TypeError: __init__ called without instance
   ```

2. **Returning `None`**:  
   Returning `None` or a different type from `__new__` will prevent `__init__` from being called.
