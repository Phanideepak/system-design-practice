# Walmart Interview Question

- A customer searching for a brand new Iphone 17 in the amazon ecommerce site. Due to heavy demand, the new Iphone 17 just went out of the stock. Customer clicked `notify me` button in the Iphone product page. Ideally Customer should get notified back when Iphone 17 stock is available.
Implement this flow in Python.

## Intuition

- Here `Observable` Component is Iphone Stock
- `Observer` is Customer who needs to be notified.
