The **Visitor Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It enables adding new operations to a group of objects without modifying their structures. The pattern is particularly useful when you want to perform different operations on a collection of objects with varying types.

---

### Key Components
1. **Visitor Interface**: Declares a set of "visit" methods, one for each type of object the visitor can handle.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the visitor interface and defines the specific behavior for each type of object.
3. **Element Interface**: Declares an `accept` method that accepts a visitor.
4. **Concrete Elements**: Implement the `accept` method to call the appropriate visitor method.
5. **Client**: Manages the objects and allows a visitor to operate on them.

### Benefits
1. **Open/Closed Principle**: You can add new operations (visitors) without modifying existing element classes.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the operation logic separate from the objects' structure.
3. **Double Dispatch**: Ensures the correct operation is executed based on both the element and visitor types.

### Example: File System Traversal
#### Scenario:
You have a file system with files and folders, and you want to perform operations like calculating the total size or listing contents.

#### Implementation:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Visitor Interface
class Visitor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def visit_file(self, file):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def visit_folder(self, folder):
        pass

# Element Interface
class Element(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def accept(self, visitor: Visitor):
        pass

# Concrete Elements
class File(Element):
    def __init__(self, name: str, size: int):
        self.name = name
        self.size = size

    def accept(self, visitor: Visitor):
        visitor.visit_file(self)

class Folder(Element):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []

    def add(self, element: Element):
        self.children.append(element)

    def accept(self, visitor: Visitor):
        visitor.visit_folder(self)

# Concrete Visitors
class SizeCalculator(Visitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_size = 0

    def visit_file(self, file: File):
        self.total_size += file.size

    def visit_folder(self, folder: Folder):
        for child in folder.children:
            child.accept(self)

class ContentLister(Visitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.contents = []

    def visit_file(self, file: File):
        self.contents.append(file.name)

    def visit_folder(self, folder: Folder):
        self.contents.append(folder.name)
        for child in folder.children:
            child.accept(self)

# Usage
root = Folder("root")
file1 = File("file1.txt", 100)
file2 = File("file2.txt", 200)
sub_folder = Folder("sub_folder")
file3 = File("file3.txt", 300)

root.add(file1)
root.add(file2)
sub_folder.add(file3)
root.add(sub_folder)

# Calculate total size
size_calculator = SizeCalculator()
root.accept(size_calculator)
print(f"Total Size: {size_calculator.total_size}")

# List contents
content_lister = ContentLister()
root.accept(content_lister)
print("Contents:", content_lister.contents)
```

### When to Use
1. When you need to perform multiple unrelated operations on objects of a class hierarchy.
2. When the object structure is stable, but the operations on the objects are frequently changing or expanding.
3. When you want to avoid adding operational logic directly into the object classes. 

This pattern is commonly used in compiler design (e.g., traversing and processing syntax trees).
