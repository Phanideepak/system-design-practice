# Components of Interpreter Design Pattern

- Context : It represents Value of the expression
- Abstract Expression: It is an interface for interpreting the expression.
- Terminal Expression:  Represents leaf node in Abstract Syntax Tree. It evaluates to value directly.
- Non Terminal Expression:  Represents Composite Expression (operators, rules).
