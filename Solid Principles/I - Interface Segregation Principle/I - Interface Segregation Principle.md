### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Definition**:  
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.  

This principle ensures that clients (classes or modules) depend only on the methods they actually use, promoting smaller and more focused interfaces.

---

### **Key Points**:
1. **Avoid Large Interfaces**:
   - Break down large, monolithic interfaces into smaller, specific ones.
   
2. **Prevent Unnecessary Dependencies**:
   - A class should not be burdened with methods that are irrelevant to its purpose.
   
3. **Interface Design**:
   - Design interfaces that cater to the specific needs of the implementing class or client.

---

### **Benefits**:
- **Improved Modularity**: Classes and interfaces are more cohesive.
- **Simpler Maintenance**: Smaller interfaces are easier to understand and change.
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Focused interfaces are more adaptable across different contexts.
- **Decoupling**: Reduces the impact of changes in unrelated parts of the system.

### **Examples**

#### **Violating ISP**
A monolithic interface with unrelated methods forces classes to implement unnecessary functionality.

```python
class Machine:
    def print_document(self):
        pass

    def scan_document(self):
        pass

    def fax_document(self):
        pass

class Printer(Machine):
    def print_document(self):
        print("Printing document")

    def scan_document(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Printer cannot scan")

    def fax_document(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Printer cannot fax")
```

- **Problems**:
  - `Printer` is forced to implement `scan_document` and `fax_document` methods it doesn’t need.
  - Violates ISP by creating unnecessary dependencies.

---

#### **Following ISP**
Refactor into smaller, focused interfaces.

```python
class Printer:
    def print_document(self):
        pass

class Scanner:
    def scan_document(self):
        pass

class FaxMachine:
    def fax_document(self):
        pass

class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner, FaxMachine):
    def print_document(self):
        print("Printing document")

    def scan_document(self):
        print("Scanning document")

    def fax_document(self):
        print("Faxing document")
```

- **Advantages**:
  - A basic printer only implements `Printer` without being forced to include scanning or faxing capabilities.
  - A multifunction device can implement multiple interfaces as needed.

### **Real-World Scenarios**

#### **1. Payment Processing**
- **Violating ISP**:
  ```python
  class PaymentGateway:
      def process_credit_card(self):
          pass
      def process_paypal(self):
          pass
      def process_crypto(self):
          pass

  class CreditCardPayment(PaymentGateway):
      def process_credit_card(self):
          print("Processing credit card payment")

      def process_paypal(self):
          raise NotImplementedError("CreditCardPayment does not support PayPal")

      def process_crypto(self):
          raise NotImplementedError("CreditCardPayment does not support Crypto")
  ```

- **Following ISP**:
  ```python
  class CreditCardProcessor:
      def process_credit_card(self):
          pass

  class PayPalProcessor:
      def process_paypal(self):
          pass

  class CryptoProcessor:
      def process_crypto(self):
          pass
  ```

  - Now each payment type implements only the functionality it requires.

---

#### **2. Employee Management**
- **Violating ISP**:
  A single interface forces all employee types to implement irrelevant methods.

  ```python
  class Employee:
      def get_salary(self):
          pass

      def assign_shift(self):
          pass

      def calculate_overtime(self):
          pass

  class Manager(Employee):
      def get_salary(self):
          print("Calculating salary")

      def assign_shift(self):
          print("Assigning shift")

      def calculate_overtime(self):
          raise NotImplementedError("Managers do not have overtime")
  ```

- **Following ISP**:
  Split the responsibilities into separate interfaces.

  ```python
  class SalaryCalculator:
      def get_salary(self):
          pass

  class ShiftScheduler:
      def assign_shift(self):
          pass

  class OvertimeCalculator:
      def calculate_overtime(self):
          pass

  class Manager(SalaryCalculator, ShiftScheduler):
      def get_salary(self):
          print("Calculating salary")

      def assign_shift(self):
          print("Assigning shift")
  ```

---

### **Best Practices for ISP**

1. **Keep Interfaces Specific**:
   - Limit interfaces to a single responsibility.
   
2. **Use Composition**:
   - Combine small interfaces when needed, rather than relying on a single large interface.

3. **Avoid Methods with Default Behavior**:
   - Prevent classes from implementing empty or placeholder methods.

4. **Apply YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**:
   - Avoid adding unnecessary methods to interfaces “just in case.”

---

### **Identifying Violations**
- **Empty Implementations**: Classes implementing methods with no actual logic.
- **Unrelated Methods**: Interfaces containing methods that cater to unrelated responsibilities.
- **Frequent Changes**: Interfaces that change often due to unrelated updates.

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**            | Smaller, more focused interfaces for specific needs.                       |
| **Key Mechanism**    | Split large interfaces into smaller, cohesive ones.                        |
| **Benefits**         | Increases modularity, reusability, and maintainability.                    |
