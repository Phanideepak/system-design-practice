The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming aimed at improving software maintainability, scalability, and robustness. Here's an overview of each principle:

---

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

- **Key Idea**: Each class should do one thing and do it well.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies debugging and testing.
  - Makes the code more modular and easier to refactor.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Violating SRP
  class Report:
      def generate(self):
          pass
      def save_to_file(self, filename):
          pass

  # Following SRP
  class Report:
      def generate(self):
          pass

  class FileSaver:
      def save_to_file(self, report, filename):
          pass
  ```

---

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
**Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **Key Idea**: Add new functionality by extending the code, not by changing existing code.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding features.
  - Makes code more flexible and scalable.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Violating OCP
  class Shape:
      def draw(self):
          pass

  class Drawing:
      def render(self, shapes):
          for shape in shapes:
              if isinstance(shape, Circle):
                  self.draw_circle(shape)
              elif isinstance(shape, Square):
                  self.draw_square(shape)

  # Following OCP
  class Shape:
      def draw(self):
          pass

  class Circle(Shape):
      def draw(self):
          pass

  class Square(Shape):
      def draw(self):
          pass

  class Drawing:
      def render(self, shapes):
          for shape in shapes:
              shape.draw()
  ```

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
**Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

- **Key Idea**: A derived class must not violate the expectations of the base class.
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures consistent behavior and avoids surprises.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Violating LSP
  class Bird:
      def fly(self):
          pass

  class Ostrich(Bird):
      def fly(self):
          raise NotImplementedError("Ostriches can't fly")

  # Following LSP
  class Bird:
      pass

  class FlyingBird(Bird):
      def fly(self):
          pass

  class Ostrich(Bird):
      pass
  ```

---

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
**Definition**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

- **Key Idea**: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces unnecessary dependencies.
  - Improves modularity and readability.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Violating ISP
  class Machine:
      def print(self):
          pass
      def scan(self):
          pass
      def fax(self):
          pass

  class Printer(Machine):
      def print(self):
          pass
      def scan(self):
          pass  # Not needed
      def fax(self):
          pass  # Not needed

  # Following ISP
  class Printer:
      def print(self):
          pass

  class Scanner:
      def scan(self):
          pass

  class Fax:
      def fax(self):
          pass
  ```

---

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- **Key Idea**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- **Benefits**:
  - Makes code more reusable and testable.
  - Decouples high-level logic from low-level details.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Violating DIP
  class Database:
      def get_data(self):
          pass

  class BusinessLogic:
      def __init__(self):
          self.db = Database()

  # Following DIP
  class DataSource:
      def get_data(self):
          pass

  class Database(DataSource):
      def get_data(self):
          pass

  class BusinessLogic:
      def __init__(self, data_source: DataSource):
          self.data_source = data_source
  ```

| **SRP**   | Responsibility | Modularity |
| **OCP**   | Extensibility | Scalability |
| **LSP**   | Substitutability | Consistency |
| **ISP**   | Interface Design | Simplicity |
